What is Clustering?
clustering organizes data points that are close into groups to find a relation or pattern.

Types of Distances: 
1. Euclidean - using Pythagoras theoram.
2. Continous - correlation similarity
3. Manhattan - using sum of all vectors. Like taxi driving through blocks of manhattan city from point A to B.

Ways of examining and organizing multi-dimensional data:
1. Heirarchical Clustering
2. K-Means Clustering - R documentation tells us that the k-means method "aims to partition the points into k groups such that 
the sum of squares from points to the assigned cluster centres is minimized."

Heirarchical Clustering techniques:
1. complete linkage
2. Average linkage
3. heat maps
