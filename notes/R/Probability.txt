| Continuous random variables are usually associated with measurements of time, distance, or some
| biological process since they can take on any value, often within some specified range. Limitations of
| precision in taking the measurements may imply that the values are discrete; we in fact consider them
| continuous.

A probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly
| equal to some value.

| For instance, suppose we have a coin which may or may not be fair. Let x=0 represent a 'heads' outcome
| and x=1 represent a 'tails' outcome of a coin toss. If p is the probability of 'heads' which of the
| following represents the PMF of the coin toss?  The variable x is either 0 (heads) or 1 (tails).

1: (p^x)*(1-p)^(1-x)
2: (p^(1-x))*(1-p)^x

A probability density function [PDF] is associated with a continuous random variable. To quote from
| Wikipedia, it "is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take
| on a given value. The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values
| is given by ... the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the
| lowest and greatest values of the range.

| We'll repeat two requirements of a probability density function [PDF]. It must be non-negative everywhere,
| and the area under it must equal one."

 The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable X, either discrete or continuous, is
| the function F(x) equal to the probability that X is less than or equal to x. In the example above,
| the area of the blue triangle represents the probability that the random variable was less than or
| equal to the value 1.6.

| When the random variable is continuous, as in the example, the PDF is the derivative of the CDF. So integrating the PDF (the line represented by the diagonal)
| yields the CDF. When you evaluate the CDF at the limits of integration the result is an area.

Now use the R function integrate to integrate mypdf with the parameters lower equal to 0 and upper equal to 1.6. See if you get the same area (probability) you
| got before.

| The survivor function S(x) of a random variable X is defined as the function of x equal to the probability that the random variable X is greater than the value x.
| This is the complement of the CDF F(x), in our example, the portion of the lower triangle that is not shaded.

| We represent the conditional probability of an event A given that B has occurred with the notation
| P(A|B). More specifically, we define the conditional probability of event A, given that B has occurred
| with the following.

  |==============                                                                                 |  14%

| P(A|B) = P(A & B)/ P(B) . P(A|B) is the probability that BOTH A and B occur divided by the probability
| that B occurs.

| From the definition of P(A|B), we can write P(A&B) = P(A|B) * P(B), right?  Let's use this to express
| P(B|A).
| P(B|A) = P(B&A)/P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B)/P(A). This is a simple form of Bayes' Rule which relates the two
| conditional probabilities.
Suppose we don't know P(A) itself, but only know its conditional probabilities, that is, the
| probability that it occurs if B occurs and the probability that it occurs if B doesn't occur. These
| are P(A|B) and P(A|~B), respectively. We use ~B to represent 'not B' or 'B complement'.

| We can then express P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) and substitute this is into the denominator
| of Bayes' Formula.

| P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / ( P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) )
