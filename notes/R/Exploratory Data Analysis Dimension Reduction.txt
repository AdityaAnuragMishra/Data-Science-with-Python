In other words, we'd like to find the best matrix created with fewer variables (that is, a lower rank
| matrix) that explains the original data. This is related to data compression.

 Two related solutions to these problems are PCA which stands for Principal Component Analysis and SVD,
| Singular Value Decomposition. This latter simply means that we express a matrix X of observations
| (rows) and variables (columns) as the product of 3 other matrices, i.e., X=UDV^t. This last term (V^t)
| represents the transpose of the matrix V.
