# Hold-out set in practice I: Classification
#
# You will now practice evaluating a model with tuned hyperparameters on a
#  hold-out set. The feature array and target variable array from the diabetes dataset have been pre-loaded as X and y.
#
# In addition to C, logistic regression has a 'penalty' hyperparameter which specifies whether to use 'l1' or 'l2'
# regularization. Your job in this exercise is to create a hold-out set, tune the 'C' and 'penalty' hyperparameters
# of a logistic regression classifier using GridSearchCV on the training set, and then evaluate its performance
# against the hold-out set.
