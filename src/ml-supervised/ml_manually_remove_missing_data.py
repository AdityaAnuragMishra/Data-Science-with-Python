# Regression with categorical features
#
# Having created the dummy variables from the 'Region' feature, you can build
# regression models as you did before. Here, you'll use ridge regression to perform 5-fold cross-validation.
# The feature array X and target variable array y have been pre-loaded.
#
# Dropping missing data
#
# The voting dataset from Chapter 1 contained a bunch of missing values that we dealt with for
# you behind the scenes. Now, it's time for you to take care of these yourself!
#
# The unprocessed dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame df. Explore it in the IPython Shell with the .head()
# method. You will see that there are certain data points labeled with a '?'. These denote missing values. As you saw
#  in the video, different datasets encode missing values in different ways. Sometimes it may be a '9999',
# other times a 0 - real-world data can be very messy! If you're lucky, the missing values will already be encoded as
#  NaN. We use NaN because it is an efficient and simplified way of internally representing missing data, and it lets
#  us take advantage of pandas methods such as .dropna() and .fillna(), as well as scikit-learn's Imputation
# transformer Imputer().
# In this exercise, your job is to convert the '?'s to NaNs, and then drop the rows that contain them from the
# DataFrame.

# Convert '?' to NaN
df[df == '?'] = np.nan

# Print the number of NaNs
